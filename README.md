## About the Project
This project implements a simple system for managing cars and garages, allowing users to manage vehicle information, track garage availability, and manage vehicle parking assignments. The application is developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), along with additional libraries for file management and utility functions. It was created as part of my university coursework to showcase my practical skills in desktop application development.

Please note that while the application provides core functionalities, it may still contain bugs or unfinished features as it is a work in progress.

## Features
- **Manage Cars**: Add, edit, and remove cars from the garage database.
- **Garage Management**: Track available spaces and garage details.
- **Parking Assignment**: Assign cars to available spaces and track their parking status.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for cars or garages based on different criteria.
- **File Management**: Data is saved and loaded using Java file I/O.
